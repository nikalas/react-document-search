# React document search and filter demo

This is a demo of a document search and filter using React. The documents and categories are loaded from an external REST API.

There is a translate [ function ](src/components/translations.jsx) that fetches UI strings from another REST endpoint, but this has been disabled for the demo project.

External libraries used:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [react-select](https://github.com/jedwatson/react-select)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

```bash
npm run dev
```
